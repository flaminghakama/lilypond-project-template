For each staff group with instruments, make two versions, one for concert and one for transposed.
Read the staff group include ly/SONG/staffgroups/STAFFGROUP.ily
Replace STAVES with includes of the ly/SONG/staves/scores/INSTRUMENT.ily, with INSTRUMENT being of the format instruentNameInKey.
For example, ly/SONG/staffgroups/transposed/Woodwinds.ily:
    \new StaffGroup = "Woodwinds" << 
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/flute.ily"
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/englishHornInF.ily"
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/bassClarinetInBb.ily"
    >>
And for concert, ly/SONG/staffgroups/concert/Woodwinds.ily:
    \new StaffGroup = "Woodwinds" << 
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/flute.ily"
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/englishHorn.ily"
		\include "ly/SONG/staves/scores/bassClarinet.ily"
    >>

In the parts for scores, include the staff group, one of the following:

    \include "ly/SONG/staffgroups/concert/STAFFGROUP.ily"
    \include "ly/SONG/staffgroups/transposed/STAFFGROUP.ily"

Take the generic staff group and insert the staves.

For each instrument ther are three or four staves;  any instrument with a transposition will have a concert version in scores.  
    staves/parts
    staves/scores/concert
    staves/scores/transposed
    staves/sound
