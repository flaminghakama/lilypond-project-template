Where we are at with the Lilypond template.

One question is how to facilitate a segmented approach to scores.  
In order to speed compilation, it is desirable to have the following fragments of the work:
    by instrumental section: woodwinds, brass, voice, percussion, strings
    for any individual parts, instrumental sections or scores, by section of the work: head, solos, coda, etc.

Defining the Instrumentation

For each instrument, we need a staff definition:  Everything that needs to go into the staff.
We currently use a template with placeholders and swap them out for each book based on the part file name.
These are incomplete, for example not specifying transposition or clef.  

So, we need a way to expand the definition.
Then, we would read these definitions and create staff blocks for each instrument and save them as files staffs/<instrument>.ily
To create the part book, we have the part template with a placeholder for the staff then inject the staff.

We also need instrumental section staffgroup definitions.
We need to define what is needed for the staff group, plus which instruments are part of the staff
Then, we would read these definitions and create staff group blocks for each section and save them as files staffgroups/<section>.ily

Then a score would be defined as a collection of staff groups and/or staves.

To embark on a scoring project, you need to create the template files:

ly/TEMPLATE/structures/header.ily
Fill out the project name, composer, etc. 
Also choose fonts

ly/TEMPLATE/structures/forms.ily
Define score segments
Each segment has its own score strcutrure and function for merging the structure with music
Enclose each structure in a tag named for the segment.

ly/TEMPLATE/structures/chords.ily
Chords for each score segment
Enclose each segment in a tag named for the segment.
Arrangements for each distinct format (no chords on head, chords on solos, no chords on coda VS chords everywhere) and transposition break

ly/TEMPLATE/structures/lyrics.ily
lyrics for each score segment
Enclose each segment in a tag named for the segment.

Books
The book file typically has a paper section, header section, then for each score segment, a score with layout or midi sections.
ly/TEMPLATE/books/BOOK.ily - template for an individual part.  
ly/TEMPLATE/books/MIDI.ily - template for multi-instrument midi block.
ly/TEMPLATE/books/SCORE.ily - template for multi-instrument layout block.  

A copy of the SCORE template is made for each part that has the word "score" or "lead" in it.
It should account for all instruments in the full score.

Once the SCORE tempalte is copied and processed for the specified parts, you are left with the task of removing or commenting out unnecessary instruments or staff groups for sub-scores.  Could this be done using tags?  Each score segment is wrapped in a tag


For all these books, we want versions for each score segment.

One approach would be using tags. 
Enclose each structure in a tag named for the structure.
In the full score book, each music element would use the tag for the score segment.
For partial scores, to remove a score segment, change the tag to something else.  Or change from include to exclude.


Likewise, 

ly/TEMPLATE/instruments
ly/TEMPLATE/instruments/INSTRUMENT.ily
ly/TEMPLATE/parts
ly/TEMPLATE/parts/PART.ly
ly/TEMPLATE/SONG.sublime-project
ly/TEMPLATE/structures
[02:01 PM] ~/Documents/git/lilypond-project-template $ 



Improvements related to tweaking layout of markup.

The structure is done by way of tags, named by segments of the piece.
You might need MIDI tags for repeats. 

Copy these tags into the structures, like 
structureHead = \relative c { 
    \tag SegmentOne { 
        \mark \markup "Head"
    	s1
    }
    \tag SegmentTwo { 
    	s1
    }
    ...
}

When you set up your structure, you will need to do it for forms, chords, and then also for markup tweaks. 

The global defintions combine the markup tweaks, for the Parts version of the global.

The other place these tags need to be is in the books, the BOOK.ily and SCORE.ily template files.
In addition to the segments, you should have appropriate tags for instruments, sections, as well as PDF/MIDI and Part/Score.  Scores should have all the instruments necessary.
